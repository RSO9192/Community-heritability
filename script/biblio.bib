	abstract = {The fact that genetic traits in one species can affect an entire ecosystem has important basic and applied implications that are only now being appreciated. The potential sphere of gene influence can be expanded from the individual and population level (that is, population genetics) to the higher levels included in community and ecosystem genetics. When this is done new fields of study are likely to emerge, such as community and ecosystem genomics.Just as the genotype has a 'traditional' phenotype that is expressed in the individual and population, its expression could also extend to levels higher than the population, to produce community and ecosystem phenotypes.Using traditional population and quantitative genetics methods we show that these community and ecosystem phenotypes are heritable and that some are likely to feed back to affect the fitness of the tree.These combined effects provide a mechanism for exploring the controversial issue of community and ecosystem evolution (that is, the change in genetic interactions between species over time).We show how a mapped trait in a common tree predictably affects the structure and composition of the arthropod community in the canopy of the tree, the microbial community in the soil, the detritivore community in an adjacent stream, the foraging of a mammalian herbivore, and the interactions of different trophic levels. In turn, these interactions predictably affect important ecosystem processes such as litter decomposition and nitrogen mineralization.Future studies will need to evaluate how genetic changes in foundation species — brought about by exotic introductions, genetic engineering and climate change — will result in new community and ecosystem phenotypes. These new phenotypes can affect community structure, biodiversity and fundamental ecosystem processes such as nutrient cycling.},

	abstract = {Evolution has been viewed as occurring primarily through selection among individuals. We present a framework based on multilevel selection for evaluating evolutionary change from individuals to communities, with supporting empirical evidence. Essential to this evaluation is the role that interspecific indirect genetic effects play in shaping community organization, in generating variation among community phenotypes, and in creating community heritability. If communities vary in phenotype, and those phenotypes are heritable and subject to selection at multiple levels, then a community view of evolution must be merged with mainstream evolutionary theory. Rapid environmental change during the Anthropocene will require a better understanding of these evolutionary processes, especially selection acting at the community level, which has the potential to eliminate whole communities while favoring others.},
